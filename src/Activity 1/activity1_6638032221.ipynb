    "From the results in Exercise 2, MD5 and SHA-1 can compute around 1.8 million hashes in a second, while bcrypt can generate only 5 hashes in a second. This shows that bcrypt is much more computationally expensive than the other 2 hashing methods. Thus it also makes it more resistant to brute force attacks.\n",

This means for each letter, it would take `94^n` searches to find the password, where `n` is the length of the password. From this value, a 10 letter password would take 94^10 searches. Divide that value by 5, the amount of hashes computed per second, we would get `94^10/5`, or `1.0772302e+19` seconds (`341,587,455,606` years)"
